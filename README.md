<h3>Motivation for this project</h3>

As an artist, I had always been intrigued sounds, as it is such a crucial part of our senses, yet it remains foreign subject. Combined with my interest in analystics and machine learning, this project is created in an attempt to understand the process of AI sound generation, hopes to create unique sounds that could be experienced in every life.

<h3>Process</h3>

This project consists of 4 parts. The 1st part focuses on visualising the audio data and gaining general knowledge of the LibRosa library. The 2nd part looks into any feature extraction of the sound file. The 3rd part focuses on training the model and the last part creates the AI generated sounds.
